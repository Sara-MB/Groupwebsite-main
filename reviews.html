      <i>“We absolutely lucked into this place. We made somewhat last minute reservations to go down to Belize and we are so lucky to have found this place.  It seemed like everyone knew our name from the moment we arrived and were treated like royalty with each interaction. The staff was very kind, and the hotel was everything we could wish for!”</i>

      <i>“This is our second time visiting Portugal, so we have a point of reference. From the pick up at the airport, and throughout our stay, the service and staff is unbelievably great! We felt like family during our stay. The food was excellent as well. If you are looking for a bustling bar scene and large crowds to party with, then you're at the right adres! Multiple activities were offered and everyday felt like a new adventure! We will definitely be back to visit again."</i>

      <i>“This was our first trip to Portugal. We had the very good fortune of 'striking it rich' by staying at the lovely Bella Vista Resort. The staff were extremely professional and considerate. We encourage others to experience the same wonderful stay that we had. Many activities ensured we had to go out of our comfort zone. I would never could've  thought I  learned so much new things, while going on vacation.”</i>

Highly recommend trying the kayak’s or diving while at Bella Vista.The owner is very welcoming and even says “Hi” and “Welcome”, awesome personal touch. “</i>
