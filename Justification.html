		<h3>Design Elements</h3><br>
		<p>The most important design element that you will find on our website is definitely our logo. It is meant to resemble the values of our company: discover, change, explore and, adventure. Following on the cleanness of the logo’s design we wanted to have a simple website where our customers can interact with our brand and get to know our team. Another focus point in the design is the multitude of pictures; when it comes to a company that focuses on traveling and adventures, the customer will always expect to see a bunch of photos and videos from all around the world. </p>
		<br>
		<h3>Prototype testing</h3>
		<br>
		<a herf="https://xd.adobe.com/view/f78089c6-073d-4191-b875-92340956e765-a2d3/">Link to the prototype</a><br><br>
		  <p>Above is the link to the prototype that was used in the  testing. A total of five people were tested with this same prototype. They were given the landing page and asked to get to two different goals: try to book a trip, and try to get to all the different pages the website has to offer. Overall, participants were asked to explain why they were clicking on a certain button and what they think it would do. Evaluators did not give the participants more instructions or explanations during the testing, in order to make sure the participants were not influenced and acted fully on their own volition. 
<br><br>
It was concluded from the testing that the participants did not have much trouble operating the prototype and getting to the goals that were set. Participants found the website easy to navigate and they were not confused by any buttons during the testing. One participant mentioned including extra pages with more information on the different destinations, but they said it was not a necessity. Participants were asked what they thought about the “Discover Your Adventure” button being on the page all the time, and they said that they found it helpful and a good addition. It made it clear that the website’s intention is to help you book a trip and the button made it easily accessible. Overall, participants could easily navigate the website and there were no anomalies. <br><br>

Based on these results, we have decided to integrate most of the existing prototype into the website itself with, of course, a more structured layout and better design. The usability of the prototype seems to be fine, which is why we believe that this prototype will be a good starting point for the eventual website.</p>
